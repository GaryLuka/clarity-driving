                                <p>I just passed my G2 licence in Newmarket ! I am so happy and grateful with Leo! 
                                    He is the best instructor, provided very details instructions on how to passed the test. 
                                    Leo provided the car to passed the test and it was an amazing experience, 
                                    since the car is new and have all accessories to park easily, it makes it even better.
                                    During the lessons he will picked and dropped me off my place and same for the road test.
                                    I asked him to book an earlier test day and he made it possible without hesitation.
                                    He is very kind, patience and respectful.
                                    I will recommend him 100% for your road tests.
                                    Thank you once again Leo.</p>

                                    attempt! He is incredibly professional, patient, and teaches 
                                    in a clear, effective manner that made me feel confident behind 
                                    the wheel. Leo even went the extra mile by booking me an early
                                    test slot himself, which helped me get my license quickly with 
                                    just a few classes. His dedication and support throughout the 
                                    process were outstanding. I highly recommend Leo to anyone

                                   I had Leo as my instructor and he showed me all the maneuvers
                                    (paralell-parking, forward and reverse parking, three-point turn, etc)
                                   I was taught in practice how to stay calm and safe on the road and

                                   I took 12 lessons with Leo, each about 2 hours long, 
                                   and every session was incredibly valuable. He explained all the 
                                   rules clearly, was very patient, and made sure I understood not 
                                   just how to pass the test, but how to be a confident and safe 
                                   driver. He always picked me up and dropped me off, which was a 
                                   huge convenience.
                                   Leo is professional, friendly, and genuinely cares about
                                   his students’ success. I couldn’t have asked for a better 
                                   instructor. If you’re looking for a reliable driving school 
                                   in Toronto, I 100% recommend Clarity Driving School — 
                                   ask for Leo!</p>

                                <p>I highly recommend giving Leo a call if you're thinking about 
                                   a driving instructor. He's a thoughtful guy, with tons of experience,
                                   who'll get you ready for your road exam.
                                   With his guidance I was able to comfortably 
                                   pass my G2 road exam in Oshawa on the first try!
                                   He handles all the logistics for you: pick-up and drop-off 
                                   for lessons, exam transportation, as well as exam booking. 
                                   He managed to get me an early exam date so I didn't have to 
                                   wait weeks to take the road test.</p>
